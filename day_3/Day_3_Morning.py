Welcome to Space Weather Simulation Summer School Day 3

Today, we will be working with various file types, doing some simple data 
manipulation and data visualization

We will be using a lot of things that have been covered over the last two days 
with minor vairation.

Goal: Getting comfortable with reading and writing data, doing simple data 
manipulation, and visualizing data.

Task: Fill in the cells with the correct codes
